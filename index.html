			<h2>About</h2>
			<blockquote>Lynbrook's National Chinese Honor Society holds weekly meetings immersing members in the Chinese culture by holding fun events along with the informative presentations. With inter-club socials, a ping-pong tournament, Chinese tutoring, and more, NCHS welcomes all students to learn more about China. All students, regardless of ethnicity or second language, are welcome to apply.</blockquote>
			<p>We meet every <b>Tuesday brunch in room 104 (Ms. Chen's room)</b>, starting 9/11.</p>
			<p>Our meetings usually consist of cultural presentations and announcements for upcoming activites. Several activities we held previously are: a Chinatown day trip, dumpling making socials, karoake, and ping-pong tournaments. In addition, our tutoring program offers experienced members a chance to tutor people in the community for pay.</p>
